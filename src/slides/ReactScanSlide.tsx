        <Text strong>React Scan</Text> is a development tool designed to

      <Paragraph>
        Optimizing React applications can be challenging. Unnecessary re-renders
        are a common source of performance problems, often caused by props
        changing reference (like inline functions or objects) even if their
        value hasn't semantically changed. React Scan makes these issues
        visible.

        dataSource={benefits}

          <List.Item>

        By integrating <Text code>@react-scan/vite-plugin-react-scan</Text> into
        our Vite setup, we get real-time feedback on component rendering
        behavior, allowing us to proactively address performance bottlenecks.
