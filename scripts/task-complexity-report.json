      "taskTitle": "Implement StateOptimizationSlide Comparing React Context Performance",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of StateOptimizationSlide into specific subtasks covering: context creation, component implementation for both standard and selector approaches, render counting mechanism, visual indicators for re-renders, control panel implementation, and integration into the presentation flow.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex React state management concepts, performance optimization, and interactive demonstrations. It requires creating a sophisticated component with side-by-side comparisons, render counting, and visual feedback. The implementation touches multiple technical areas including context API, performance optimization, and UI development."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the React Server Components slide review into subtasks covering: technical content verification focusing on RSC concepts, code example validation, preparation of visual aids if needed, and updating the presentation status.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves reviewing content on React Server Components, which is a relatively new and complex topic. It requires up-to-date knowledge of RSC concepts and implementation details. The complexity is moderate as it involves content review rather than implementation, but the technical subject matter is advanced."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Build & Deployment slide completion into subtasks covering: review of existing content, research on missing CI/CD information, documentation of deployment strategies, addition of containerization details if applicable, and updating the presentation status.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves not just reviewing but completing documentation on build and deployment processes. It requires research and knowledge of CI/CD, deployment strategies, and potentially containerization. The complexity is higher because it involves creating new content on technical topics rather than just reviewing."
