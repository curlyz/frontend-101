# Introduction to SPA and React - Definitions

## Main Ideas to Convey

- Define Single Page Application (SPA) and its advantages.
- Define React as a frontend library for building SPAs with reusable components.

## Visual Ideas

- **Diagram 1 (SPA Concept):**
    - Left side: Traditional multi-page app (server sends new HTML page for each interaction).
    - Right side: SPA (server sends initial HTML/JS, then JS updates content dynamically).
    - Arrows showing data flow and page loads.
- **Illustration (React Logo + Components):**
    - React logo prominent.
    - Surrounded by various abstract shapes labeled "Component A", "Component B", "Component C" fitting together like puzzle pieces to form a UI outline.

## Content

SPA (Single Page Application) is a web app that loads only 1 document (which also called root document), then updates body content of that document via Javascript API to show different content. This approach allows user to use website without loading whole new pages from server and speed up performance.

In case, React is a front-end library for building SPA by writing reusable components with high interactivity and combine them together to flexible user interfaces. React components will be mounted to root document and rendered to create different UI. On next part, we will discuss about how React manage changes and mount new UI.
