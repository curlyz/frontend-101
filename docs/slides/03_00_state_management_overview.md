# React State Management - Overview

## Prerequisites
1. You need to understand the slide content, and search for online blogs about that topic
2. Read at least 3 blogs online
3. You should be creative on how to represent your ideas
4. You should write each slides to be isolated, that is each slide page is a folder, which contain all the necessary files for that page, don't share with other slides


## Main Ideas to Convey

- Recap limitations of component state and props for sharing state (prop drilling).
- Introduce the need for dedicated state management solutions for complex applications.
- Mention React Context API as a built-in solution and Redux as a popular third-party library.

## Visual Ideas

- **Before/After Diagram (Prop Drilling vs. State Management):**
    - **Before:** Show the "prop drilling" diagram (Grandparent -> Parent -> Child -> Grandchild with props passed down).
    - **After:** Show a centralized store (Context Provider or Redux Store icon) with arrows directly to Grandparent, Child, and Grandchild, bypassing intermediate components.
- **Logos:** Display React Context logo and Redux logo side-by-side when introducing them.

## Content

In earlier chapters, we discussed how a component can manage its own state and pass it down to child components. However, sharing state between sibling components or deeply nested children can become difficult due to prop drilling. To address this, React introduced the Context API for easier state sharing across the component tree. Additionally, third-party libraries like Redux offer more advanced and scalable solutions for managing shared state in larger applications.
