# Package Management - npm vs yarn

## Prerequisites
1. You need to understand the slide content, and search for online blogs about that topic
2. Read at least 3 blogs online
3. You should be creative on how to represent your ideas
4. You should write each slides to be isolated, that is each slide page is a folder, which contain all the necessary files for that page, don't share with other slides


## Main Ideas to Convey

- Briefly describe `npm` (default for Node.js, largest registry).
- Briefly describe `Yarn` (alternative, focusing on speed, reliability, security).
- Present a comparison table highlighting key differences (Pre-installed, Speed, Offline Install, Lockfile).
- Conclude with the recommendation for Yarn based on performance and consistency (as per original text).

## Visual Ideas

- **Logos:** Prominently display `npm` and `Yarn` logos.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Use the existing table format, but perhaps add icons or visual cues next to "Faster" (e.g., rocket for Yarn, snail for npm older versions), "Robust Offline Install" (e.g., checkmark for Yarn).
- **Lockfile Icons:** Show a small visual of what `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` might conceptually represent (e.g., a specific key for a specific lock).

## Content

npm is the default package manager for NodeJs, and it's the largest software registry in the world. It allows JavaScript developers to share and reuse code through packages (also called modules) and manages project dependencies efficiently.

On the other hand, yarn is a fast, reliable, and secure alternative to npm to address some performance and consistency issues found in earlier versions of npm.

| Aspect                  | npm                   | Yarn                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pre-installed with Node | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No (install separately) |
| Speed                   | Slower (v6 and below) | Faster                   |
| Offline Install         | Limited               | Robust                   |
| Lockfile                | `package-lock.json`   | `yarn.lock`              |

In conclusion, yarn is more recommended in managing package for faster performance and consistent dependencies over various environment
