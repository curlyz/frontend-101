# Package Management - Overview

## Prerequisites
1. You need to understand the slide content, and search for online blogs about that topic
2. Read at least 3 blogs online
3. You should be creative on how to represent your ideas
4. You should write each slides to be isolated, that is each slide page is a folder, which contain all the necessary files for that page, don't share with other slides

## Main Ideas to Convey

- Define package management as handling project dependencies (libraries, tools, frameworks).
- Explain why it's crucial in React projects (ecosystem of third-party packages).
- List tasks automated by a package manager (installing, updating, versioning, resolving dependencies, running scripts).
- Mention `npm` and `Yarn` as typical package managers for React.

## Visual Ideas

- **Illustration (Dependency Web):** Show a central "My Project" node connected to various package nodes (e.g., "React", "Lodash", "Axios", "ESLint"), which themselves might have sub-dependencies, illustrating the complexity managed by package managers.
- **Icons for Package Manager Tasks:**
    - Install: Download icon.
    - Update: Refresh/Up-arrow icon.
    - Versioning: Tag/Label icon (e.g., v1.2.3).
    - Resolve Dependencies: Puzzle pieces fitting together.
    - Run Scripts: Play button/Terminal icon.
- **Logos:** Display `npm` and `Yarn` logos when they are introduced.

## Content

Package management is the process of handling dependencies—libraries, tools, and frameworks—that a project needs to run. In a React project, developers often rely on a vast ecosystem of third-party packages to enhance functionality, speed up development, or integrate tools like linters, testing libraries, or UI frameworks.

A package manager automates:

* Installing and updating packages
* Managing versioning
* Resolving dependencies
* Running scripts (e.g., build, test)

React projects typically use either npm or Yarn as the package manager.
