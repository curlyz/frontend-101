# React State Management - Conclusion

## Prerequisites
1. You need to understand the slide content, and search for online blogs about that topic
2. Read at least 3 blogs online
3. You should be creative on how to represent your ideas
4. You should write each slides to be isolated, that is each slide page is a folder, which contain all the necessary files for that page, don't share with other slides


## Main Ideas to Convey

- Summarize that both Context API and Redux are useful state management tools.
- Position Context API as ideal for simpler apps and avoiding prop drilling.
- Position Redux as better suited for larger, complex applications needing centralized and predictable state management.
- Emphasize that the choice depends on application complexity, team experience, and specific needs.

## Visual Ideas

- **Decision Tree/Flowchart:**
    - Start: "Need to share state?"
    - If No -> Component State is fine.
    - If Yes -> "Is prop drilling becoming an issue or is the state complex/global?"
        - If No (or simple state) -> Consider React Context.
        - If Yes (complex, many updates, middleware needed) -> Consider Redux.
    - Add branches for "Team Familiarity?" or "Performance Critical?" for more nuanced decisions.
- **Scale/Complexity Meter:**
    - Show a spectrum from "Simple App" to "Complex Enterprise App".
    - Place React Context logo towards the simpler end.
    - Place Redux logo towards the complex end.

## Content

In conclusion, Context API and Redux are useful state management tools in React for different use cases. Context is ideal for simpler apps and avoiding prop drilling, while Redux is better for larger, more complex applications that require centralized and predictable state management. The right choice depends on your app's complexity, team experience, and specific needs. On next chapter, we will explore about react client component and server components.
